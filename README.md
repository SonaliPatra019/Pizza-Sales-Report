An interactive and data-driven dashboard created to analyze pizza sales performance across different categories, sizes, and time periods—enabling stakeholders to identify key trends, best/worst performers, and drive smarter decision-making.

2.📌 Short Description / Purpose
The Pizza Pulse Dashboard is a dynamic Power BI report that visualizes key metrics and trends from a year’s worth of pizza sales data. It helps business stakeholders, restaurant managers, and analysts understand which pizza types drive the most revenue, when peak orders occur, and which items are underperforming—empowering more informed marketing, staffing, and inventory decisions.

3.🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create calculated columns, KPIs, and dynamic visual metrics.
📂 Power Query – For transforming and cleaning data before visualization.
🗃️ SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – Used to write SQL queries that extracted key metrics, summaries, and pivoted data directly from the pizza sales Excel source.
🔗 SQL Server Connection – Established a live connection between SSMS and Power BI for real-time data updates.
📁 .pbix – Power BI file format for design and deployment.
🧭 Navigation Buttons – Implemented for intuitive page switching between "Home" and "Best/Worst Sellers".
